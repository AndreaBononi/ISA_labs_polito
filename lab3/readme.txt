The directories "mod_netlist" and "innovus_mod" are related to the modified version of the riscV architecture (which includes the hardware absolute value evaluation).

The directories "netlist" and "innovus" are related to the base version of the riscV architecture (in which the absolute value must be calculated in software).

The directory "src" contains all the vhdl source files related to the base version and a sub-directory "mod" containing some source files employed in the modified version.

All the sdf files are compressed due to their large size.
